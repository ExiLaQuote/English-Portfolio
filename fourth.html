          I am a skyscraper. My floors are only what they are insofar as I love what I love and do what I have to do. Without those pillars, everything collapses. I am a skyscraper. My head might seem up in the clouds but I am rooted on the ground. Every day I strive to cleanse myself of the filth that darkens my window panels. After all, this is the first impression other people have of me. For when the glass shines, I am able to reflect the heavenly light that comes from the Son above.         </p>

          And despite all that was said, I still want to grow! I want to strive to be the tallest building I can be. Even though I one day scrape the sky, I will never look down on others; instead I shall be the scaffolding and the stairs which others may climb to reach the top. And up there, through me, I hope they see what I see—a picturesque view of a beautiful world.
