          Second, I regard my responsibilities as necessities. Sure, I may not always volunteer to be the leader. However, if friends are willing to make me one, then I will give it everything I have. Being the eldest of busy parents, I had no choice but to be independent and self-sufficient. For instance, when it was time to apply for Ateneo, my family as well as external circumstances were hard-pressed in objecting to everything. And within those eight months of lonely persuasion, I had to repeatedly call the school myself, enroll myself, and be responsible for reading up on every nugget of news.</p>
        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          My mind was not set on making a possibility come true, but instead fulfilling a necessity. Reaching up high for Ateneo became an axiom. That same characteristic applies itself to programming projects, exercising, and doing my best in academics. When I catch myself complaining, I remind myself that I have to and that I must. </p>
