          First, intellect will only go as far as my passion and determination are willing to take it. That is the principle I have discovered through all my years of learning. I will never claim to be smart, because the true underlying virtue is the drive and heart to educate myself in everything. After studying English for school, I would study linguistics at home. To take a break from physics, I rest by watching videos on quantum mechanics.</p>
        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          Regardless of how it sounds, my motivation and disposition are no different from that of one who likes to watch baking vlogs. However, sometimes my love for a subject is not equivalent to my competence. Such was the case for Filipino, singing, mathematics, and science. I was helplessly rubbish at them, and I realized that it takes more love to be good at something I am not. So I chose to persist through midnights, summers, and Christmas breaks. <br><br>The walls on those floors were casted with iron.</p>
