          I am Andrew. Some friends say I am tall. This is not what defines me; so what does? Like everyone else, I am comprised of several floors, every layer exhibiting a field of interest. And as a sentimental edifice, one which likes to keep the past alive within myself, each room stores a certain memory. Some rooms are the only places in which I am able to sleep, while other rooms are never visited again. This skyscraper is not hollow. It has objects and trinkets, yes, but more importantly it has visitors. Most of them only hang around the floors that align with their interests, while a few have seen every single room.         </p>

          There are also many walls in this building. There are those that are formidable, and there are those with holes—punctured and punched by the faults and suffering of myself and others. What never fails, however, are two central pillars which run upwards through all floors and the domains of my soul. These are my qualities and what I have constructed and rigorously developed to be two of my personal philosophies: passionate intellect and axiomatic responsibility.         </p>
